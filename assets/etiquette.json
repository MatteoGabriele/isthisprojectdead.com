  "Be kind. Maintainers have lives too.",
  "If you see a stale issue, ask if you can help fix it!",
  "Open source is a team sport. Offer help instead of asking for updates.",
  "Maintainers aren’t robots—give them a break!",
  "Instead of complaining, see if you can pitch in.",
  "A stale repo isn’t always dead—maybe it just doesn’t need updates!",
  "Don’t forget to say thank you—maintainers love appreciation.",
  "Be patient—open source runs on spare time, not deadlines.",
  "Ask with kindness, and you’re more likely to get help!",
  "If it’s really important to you, maybe sponsor the project!",
  "A polite question goes a long way.",
  "Maybe they’re fixing other projects first.",
  "They might be recharging with some fresh air and coffee.",
  "They’re prioritizing sleep over code today."
