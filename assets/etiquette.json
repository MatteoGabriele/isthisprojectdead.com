  "Be kind—maintainers have lives too.",
  "If you see a stale issue, ask if you can help fix it.",
  "Open source is a team sport—offer help instead of asking for updates.",
  "A stale repo isn’t always dead—maybe it just doesn’t need updates.",
  "Don’t forget to say thank you—maintainers love appreciation.",
  "Be patient—open source often runs on spare time, not strict deadlines.",
  "Ask with kindness and you’re more likely to get help!",
  "If it’s really important to you, consider sponsoring the project.",
  "A polite question goes a long way."
